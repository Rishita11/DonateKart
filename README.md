# Introduction: 

It's no doubt that most charities would cease to exist without these donations, which is why having a website is critical for generating awareness, soliciting donations, and establishing relationships with supporters in order to keep the funding flowing.
Websites bring out your company's personality and offer a level of intimacy that traditional marketing and advertising language can't match. You give users a reason to stay on your site by creating regular blog updates.

# What is HelpNeedy:

Our website will act as a bridge for connecting contributors to numerous non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work in a variety of areas, such as assisting orphanages, illiterate people, cancer patients, and so on.
